					<h1>Rekindling Your Passion for Web Design</h1>

					<h2>By Jeremy Girard</h2>
					
					<h3>
						<span class="article-detail">May 22, 2015</span>
						<span class="article-detail">Inspiration, Opinion Column</span>
						<span class="article-detail">20 Comments</span>
					</h3>

					<p>I love being a web designer and I'm incredibly thankful that I decided to join this industry many years ago. Still, despite my love of this profession, there have been a number of times during my career when my passion has waned and I’ve found myself simply going through the motions instead of fully applying myself to my work. This scenario is likely familiar to many of my fellow web designers. It is called burnout.</p>
					
					<img>
					
					<p class="paragraph-2">Burnout is a very real challenge that we face as web professionals. The same processes that help us complete projects successfully can also contribute to us falling into a routine and hitting autopilot on our work. Sometimes, an overload of work can force you to fall into a routine and become a production line in order to meet deadlines. Other times, a lack of variety and excitement can lead to apathy with burnout not far behind.</p>
